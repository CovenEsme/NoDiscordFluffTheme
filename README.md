# NoDiscordFluffTheme

A collection of basic css "themes" which remove buttons for annoying or cluttering Discord functions (things like the nitro button in the message bar).

## How to use

These files were made for use with the Vencord custom Discord client. They can likely be used with other custom clients but this hasn't been tested.

For each of the features you would like, open the Vencord settings page and navigate to the "Themes" tab.

On the Themes page, navigate to the "Online Themes" tab at the top of the screen.
